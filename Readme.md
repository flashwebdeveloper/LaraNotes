# This is a Collaborative Note App using Laravel

## Usage
* Register at least two users
* Create a note from user
* Visit the edit note page by clicking the title of the note
* Copy the edit note url and paste it in another browser window where the other user is logged in.
* Edit from both ends
* See the magic!!

## Roadmap
* Share functionality. So, user doesn't have to copy the url
